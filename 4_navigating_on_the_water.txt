NAVIGATING ON THE WATER
While navigating on the water, boaters are responsible to be knowledgeable of the water ways, its rules, regulations, navigation aids, general rules of the roads, restrictions and especially how to navigate safely including speed safety, weather conditions, local hazards, etc. It is important for the operator to ensure that he/she does not operate the vessel in a careless manner without due care and attention or without reasonable consideration for other persons, vessels, or the environment. This section and the information throughout the manual are meant to inform you as a boater about your responsibilities in the water.

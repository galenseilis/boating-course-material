TRIP PLAN
The main objective of the Trip Plan is to help a search and rescue team in the event you get lost.

Before heading out, complete the Trip Plan with the necessary details that could assist if an emergency call is necessary.

The first section of the trip plan should include a full and detailed description of the boat (size, color, make, engine type etc). It should also include a list of the major safety equipment on board and type of monitored radio channel (HF, VHF, MF). A section of the trip plan should include details of the trip: itinerary, dates, length of the trip, etc. Finally, it should also include information on the owner (or operator if different) and all passengers onboard. All this information can be proven to be very important and pertinent when a search and rescue party is sent out.

In the last part, provide instructions in case of emergency. Before heading out, it is important to leave a copy of the plan with a responsible person such as the port master, a good friend or a family member.

If, for any reason your itinerary changes, and you decide to return to the marina earlier or later than planned, inform the person who has your trip plan so they will not inadvertently start a search. It is then, very important to close the trip plan when it has been completed.

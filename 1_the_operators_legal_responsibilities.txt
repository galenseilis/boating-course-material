THE OPERATORâ€™S LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES
he person in charge of a craft is called the Operator. He/she has many responsibilities for the safety and welfare of the passengers on board as well as to other passing crafts. The operator must know a range of information in order to operate a pleasure craft on the water. Operators must be aware and know the limitations of the vessel they are operating. Similar boats will manoeuvre differently in different weather conditions, or the way they are loaded. The operator must be comfortable operating the boat; this will reduce the risk of being in an emergency situation and possibly risking the safety of people on board. Up-to-date regulations regarding nautical terms and actions must be known as well as weather forecasting.

For example, it is important that all persons on board know the following:

location of the personal flotation devices (PFD) or lifejackets;
the techniques of how to put on the PFD or the lifejackets (on board or in the water);
the importance of wearing them at all times;
the location of the emergency equipment kit and fire extinguishers;
the importance of keeping a low position and to hold on to a rigid part of the craft while moving around on board;
the importance of keeping hands, arms and legs inside the craft when near the dock;
the effect of the motion of the craft, sunlight, waves, wind, sound and alcohol.
Rescue procedures should be practiced so that each person on board knows what to do in case of an emergency and is familiar with:

the purpose and use of the safety equipment;
the movement of the pleasure craft;
tasks to be completed.
The operator must recognize that, in the interest of safety, there are laws and regulations that must be respected. Violations can result in boating incidents and therefore have various assigned penalties. Boaters should understand the civil liability implications of recreational boating.

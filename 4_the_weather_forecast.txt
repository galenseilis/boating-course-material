THE WEATHER FORECAST
The operator of a pleasure craft should always check the weather forecast before departing to ensure that his vessel and persons on board are safe from possible danger. The weather and water conditions can play an important role in your safety on the water. Before you leave, make sure you get the latest weather forecasts for your area. You should also be aware of local factors (such as topography) that may affect the weather. A good source of information for specific situations is local people who are familiar with the area. Summer thunderstorms can strike quickly and without warning when you are navigating. Remember to keep an eye on the sky. If the sky starts to look dark and cloudy and conditions are changing rapidly, head for shore. Remember to check your references for navigation, including charts, before you leave so you know where to find a refuge quickly in time of need if the threatening weather continues you can refer to the Charts and Sailing Directions and Cruising guide, published by CHS. If you do not have charts, you could find your bearings by observing the shore or the area and establish reference points.

You can obtain the weather forecast via all media (radio, television, newspaper etc). For example, one can look at the weather station on TV. Most newspapers also show local forecast charts. You can also contact Environment Canada, use the marine radio and, finally, you can make your own personal observations. There are many ways of observing the local weather: by flying a flag: by watching the movements of tree branches, the direction of smoke from a chimney, or by the direction and height of waves and, for the well informed, by observing a barometer and the clouds.

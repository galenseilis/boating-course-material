CANADA SHIPPING ACT 2001
The Canada Shipping Act 2001 is the law that, along with its regulations, governs pleasure crafts. It includes the requirements of some international agreements that govern the conduct of all vessels. The most important regulations affecting pleasure crafts under this law include:

Competency of Operators of Pleasure Craft Regulations;
Collision Regulations;
Small Vessel Regulations;
Vessel Operation Restriction Regulations; and
Regulations for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and for Dangerous Chemicals.
These and other boating regulations are available at www.boatingsafety.gc.ca

According to this law, the operator must assist every person who is found at sea and in danger of being lost. If you are involved in an accident, you must absolutely stop to offer assistance to the other craft involved unless it puts your craft and passengers into added danger.

Your name and address as well as the name and address of the owner of the craft must be provided to the owner of the other craft involved. Another rule is that the operator of a craft must watch for signals that indicate distress and need of assistance by others.

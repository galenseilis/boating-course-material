THE EFFECT OF ALCOHOL ON BOATING SAFETY
We must always be aware of the fact that alcohol consumption as well as the motion of the pleasure craft, the sun, the waves, the wind and sound can seriously limit a person’s capacity to operate a pleasure craft. It can negatively affect operators and passengers on board in terms of:

balance
coordination
reflexes
judgement
response time
eyesight, and/or
hearing
The effect of one glass of alcohol while on water is equivalent to three on land. Illicit drugs (even prescribed drugs) and other controlled substances may impair a person’s ability to operate a vessel.

The Criminal Code severely penalizes anyone who does not respect the alcohol limit allowed on a craft.

Although the Criminal code falls under a federal law, certain application (i.e. alcohol levels) falls under provincial jurisdiction. Some provinces will have a .08 % acceptable alcohol content, while other provinces will have a zero level of tolerance.

Please verify with your local and provincial law enforcement offices

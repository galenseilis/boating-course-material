REGULATIONS REGARDING SMALL CRAFTS
The Small Vessel Regulations states that you must carry minimum safety equipment on board your pleasure craft based on its length and type. Larger crafts must carry more safety equipment than smaller ones as they navigate further away from shore and need more complex safety equipment in case of emergency. All the safety equipment on board must be in good working order and must be maintained in accordance with the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. They must be readily available and easily accessible to everyone on board in case of an emergency and not locked up in storage compartments.

The safety equipment required by small pleasure crafts is outlined in the Small Vessel Regulations. (For additional information, visit //laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2010-91/) These are based according to length and category of the craft and they fall under two categories of pleasure craft:

Human Powered Pleasure Craft
Pleasure Crafts other than human powered Crafts
Note that, if your craft is missing the required equipment,you may put your passengers and yourself in danger and possibly receive a fine.

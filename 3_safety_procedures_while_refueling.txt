SAFETY PROCEDURES WHILE REFUELING
Raw fuel is extremely harmful to the environment and the vapours create a fire hazard. Follow the fuelling procedure step by step.

Moor the craft tightly to the dock to prevent spillage.
Turn off the engine.
Before beginning the procedure, extinguish all on board flames (smoking or cooking flames etc.)
All uninvolved persons must leave the craft.
One must not smoke while refuelling.
Turn off all electronic devices such as radios, switches and batteries; one spark caused by a short in those electrical devices could produce an explosion.
The doors, windows and hatches must be closed. Gasoline fumes are heavier than air, so they could spread to the bottom of the craft and cause an explosion when the engine is started.
Portable tanks must always be off the boat while refuelling. If there is a spillage of fuel, it would not land on the boat, but on the dock so there would be less chance of an explosionÂ­.
With a fixed tank, it is important to ground the gas nozzle against the filler pipe to ensure it is safe; This is to prevent any spillage of gasoline in the boat or water but mostly to avoid static as a spark could cause an explosion.
Do not overfill the fuel tank. Any overflow could leak through the ventilation or into the water and pollute the environment. You are obligated to clean up any gasoline spilled on the craft or on the dock immediately. Throw away rags in approved containers.
Check for vapour odours
*The basic guideline to estimate the amount of fuel needed for a trip is: One-third for the trip out, one-third for the return, and one-third as reserve.

If you have an onboard engine, the blower must be on for at least 4 minutes before starting the engine. This will enable any dangerous fumes to fully evaporate.

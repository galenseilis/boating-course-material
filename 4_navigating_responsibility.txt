NAVIGATING RESPONSIBILITY
Safety is a shared responsibility of Canadian waterway users and the organizations that govern them. Boaters must operate their boats safely. Boaters should be aware of situations that could jeopardize the safety of a boat and everyone on board, while on the water, they must be able to adapt to changing conditions.

RADAR REFLECTOR

A pleasure craft less than 20 meters long or which is mainly built of non-metallic materials, must be equipped with a passive radar reflector. Radar reflectors are a valuable piece of safety equipment required under the Collision Regulations because they help larger boats detect your presence on their radar screens. It must be mounted or suspended at least 4 meters above the water.If the craft is used in light traffic conditions during the day and with favourable weather conditions, the law does not require a radar reflector be used. The craft is not required to have one if it is not essential to the safety of your vessel or it is impractical to mount.

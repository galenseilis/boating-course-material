SAFETY EQUIPMENT
Now, we are going to study all aspects of safety regarding a pleasure craft, starting with the required safety equipment on board. Letâ€™s begin by identifying each piece of safety equipment required. This is determined by the type and the length of the craft in accordance with the Regulations for small crafts.

It is important to maintain the safety equipment that is on board. This means it must always be kept in perfect working order at all times. It should be carefully checked prior to departure. Also, safety equipment should always be placed in the craft where it can be made quickly available for all passengers.

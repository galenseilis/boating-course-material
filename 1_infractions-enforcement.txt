INFRACTIONS â€“ ENFORCEMENT
Since the beginning of the new regulation for Boat Safety on April 1st, 1999, it is now possible for a Peace Officer at any level of government to fine someone on the spot, for disregarding one or more of the laws and Regulations. Contrary to the previous regulation, Peace Officers would give a simple warning or a written notice. The judge would determine if a fine was deserved or not.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), provincial and municipal police forces and other authorized local authorities enforce the laws that apply to boats. They may inspect (courtesy program) your boat and monitor your boating activities to make sure that requirements are being met. This may include checking for safety equipment, your Pleasure Craft Operator Card and careless operation on the water.

Here is a list of some boating offences:

not having enough approved lifejackets on board;
not having the required proof of competency on board;
not having the required Pleasure Craft Licence on board;
careless operation;
speeding;
allowing someone under age to operate a boat;
operating a boat if you are under age;
operating a boat without a working muffler in good condition;
towing someone without a spotter.

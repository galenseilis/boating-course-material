SAFETY
It is critical that you, as a boat operator, recognize behaviours or events that contribute to the majority of boating related incidents and fatalities so that you can avoid them. There are many actions that can be taken to avoid/reduce boating related incidents: wearing a personal floating device; knowing how to recover a person who has fallen overboard; knowing what to do in the event your watercraft is involved in a collision or is about to capsize; being aware of the impact and effect on the operator if his or her faculties have been reduced by alcohol or drugs; the impact of the operator fatigue and heat stroke. Be careful of heat stroke which is manifested by dizziness, headache and muscle cramps. This section and the information throughout the manual are meant to inform you as a boater about the specific on-water danger that all too often goes unacknowledged. This is in order to be better prepared and to be able to deal with on-water dangers and/or emergencies.

As boat operators you must be aware of situations that could jeopardize the safety of people aboard while on the water as situations keep changing and you must adapt to these changing situations. In particular the operator should recognize that small open boats such as row boats, kayaks, canoes, etc. could be subject to capsizing or taking on water while operating close to them.

In order to assist you in the event of such accidents wearing your PFD will possibly prevent you from drowning. Statistics shows that the vast majority of Canadian boating victims were not wearing their life jacket or personal floating device when they drowned. Donâ€™t just have it in the boat, choose one that fits and wear it.

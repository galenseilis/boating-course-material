COLLISION REGULATIONS
The Collision Regulations require that someone must always be on the lookout in order to prevent the risk of collision. The boat should never be left on auto-pilot and the lookout post should never be left unattended. Furthermore, the responsibilities of the lookout person include not only watching, but also listening for warning signals coming from other crafts. The operator of a pleasure craft must apply the International Regulations to prevent collision at sea and the Canadian modifications on the high seas as well as on the waters connected which are navigable by ships.

The operator must also know the regulations specific to certain waters in Canada and the US.

The operator must assume a visual and auditory lookout at all time.

The operator of a pleasure craft is responsible for taking full advantage of radio and radar as well as of the prevailing circumstances and conditions all around him, including that of other craft and of inclement weather in order to make a complete and accurate judgement of the situation to determine if the risk of collision exists.

The operator of a pleasure craft should always move along at a safe speed so that he would be able to stop at a good distance considering the given conditions especially in reduced or restricted visibility.

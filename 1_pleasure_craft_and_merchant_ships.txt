PLEASURE CRAFT AND MERCHANT SHIPS
Pleasure Crafts are boats, ships, vessels or all other water crafts that are used exclusively for pleasure and do not carry passengers or goods for hire, remuneration, reward or any type of profit. Merchant ships are generally built according to more rigorous specifications than those of pleasure crafts. They must accomplish harder more intensive tasks, such as transporting passengers and commercial goods for profit.

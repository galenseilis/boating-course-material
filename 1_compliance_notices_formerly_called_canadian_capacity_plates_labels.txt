COMPLIANCE NOTICES (FORMERLY CALLED CANADIAN CAPACITY PLATES / LABELS)
A Compliance Notice is a statement from the manufacturer or importer that a vessel has been built according to the construction standards of the Small Vessel Regulation. This Regulations states that, with a few exceptions, all pleasure craft of less than 24 metres and that are fitted or can be fitted with an engine, must have a Compliance Notice permanently attached to the craft. Some exceptions are:

if a vessel is built or imported by an individual for their personal use
a tug
a high â€“powered vessel used exclusively for racing
a vessel that is open construction, not mass produced, not propelled or designed to be propelled by an in-board or sterndrive engine, and that has been built based on traditional methods that have been proven safe over the years.
A Compliance Notice is either a glued-on label or a riveted plate, as long as it is easily visible from the helm. No one is allowed to remove or alter a Compliance Notice, or even attach a Compliance Notice that contains incorrect information about the vessel.

Vessels measuring up to 6 m long

This Compliance Notice specifies the maximum gross load capacity that the craft can take in order to navigate safely.

The Compliance Notice is the same for pleasure crafts and non-pleasure crafts. The notice must contain a statement that the craft meets the construction requirements as per the Small Vessel Regulations and identifies the recommended safe limits for the vessel, both in number of persons on board and weight of cargo and engine. The Compliance Notice is slightly different whether it is an outboard engine or if it is an inboard or stern-drive engine. The following are examples of those particular Compliance Notices:



Pleasure crafts fitted with outboard engine



Pleasure crafts fitted with an inboard engine

Pleasure crafts more than 6 m long

The compliance notice must contain a statement of compliance indicating that the craft was built to the pleasure craft construction requirement of the Small Vessel Regulations. Here is an example:

compliance3(1)

A pleasure craft measuring more than 6 m long must not be used for non-pleasure purposes unless it has been modified to meet the construction requirements of non pleasure crafts (per Small Vessel Regulations).

A Compliance notice affixed to the vessel and issued by another country or organization (i.e. the U.S. Coast Guard) is not prohibited, but it does not replace the requirement to have a Canadian Compliance Notice attached.

It is important to remember that the maximum safe limits on the compliance notice apply in good weather. The number of people, equipment carried will depend greatly on the weather and the water conditions, therefore the operator must know and respect the safe limits described in the compliance notice.

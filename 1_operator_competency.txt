OPERATOR COMPETENCY
As of September 15, 2009, everyone who operates a motorized pleasure craft must carry proof of competency on board at all times. Proof of competency is not required for a pleasure craft without a motor.

The operator competency requirements do not currently apply in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.

Proof of competency can take one of three different forms:

 a Pleasure Craft Operator Card;
 proof, such as a course certificate, that you have successfully completed a boating safety course in Canada before April 1, 1999; or
a completed rental boat safety checklist.
The boat rental safety check list is a valid proof of competency in the case of a person who is renting a boat from a rental agency and does not have a pleasure craft operator card or other recognized certificate. Individuals renting a pleasure craft fitted with or without a motor (a person can bring their own motor) that do not meet the requirements stated above will be required to complete a rental boat safety check list. The renter must initial each box/statement (15 of them) on the form as the subject is covered by the rental operator/outfitter. This completed and duly signed form (customer and renter) must be carried on board for the duration of the rental.



The Pleasure Craft Operator Card is good for life. Remember to make a photocopy of your card as soon as you get it so it can be replaced if it is lost. To replace a lost card, contact us directly.

You must have your original proof of competency on board all the time while on the water.

SPEED AND SAFETY
The Vessel Operation Restriction Regulations do not specify speed limits because a safe speed depends on the craft and the prevailing conditions, this applies for all vessels. The operator, when determining a safe speed, must take into account the following factors: visibility, traffic density, wind conditions, tides, currents, ice weather conditions and navigational hazards. The operator of a pleasure craft that is not within sight of other vessels and in or near an area of restricted visibility must navigate at a safe speed at all times, operators must adapt to the prevailing circumstances and conditions of restricted visibility.

When operating a craft at high speed, a longer distance is required to stop the craft. The operator has to be more attentive because his reaction time to changing conditions has diminished. At times of low visibility, the regulations require an operator to adopt a speed based on the prevailing conditions, like at night or when there is fog. Simply put, the operator must slow down in bad weather to avoid losing control of the craft and endangering persons on board.

It is dangerous to navigate close to the wake of a big ship. The water turbulence that it produces could cause a loss of control of their craft. The wake produced by a pleasure craft is not like those of a big ship, but they could easily overturn a canoe. Therefore, keep in mind when navigating that the wake created could endanger other pleasure craft operators.

Each operator is responsible for the wake that he or she creates. Therefore, you must be alert and overtake another boat with care at all times and at a safe speed so that your wake will not adversely affect:

Other vessels, including anchored vessels, grounded vessels, wrecks, dredges, tows, rowboats or canoes;
Work being done on the shoreline, docks, floats, or wetlands;
Other waterway users such as swimmers; or
Areas of bathing beaches, areas where divers are working, or areas of anchorage.

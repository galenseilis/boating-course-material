With regards to boats of 12 meters (39 feet 4 inches) long or more, they must be equipped with a permanently fitted whistle (see above). Vessels over 20 m (65 ft 7 in) must be equipped with a bell as well. Please refer to the Collision Regulations for detailed technical requirements.

In reduced visibility, all boats must use sound signals to inform other vessels of their presence. Therefore, operators are required to know that there are various sound signals (as well as knowing how to use them) that indicates movement in a particular direction or that attract attention to themselves especially in restricted visibility such as fog. Such sound signals could be continuous fog horns, bell, whistle, or at the extreme a gun at one minute interval.

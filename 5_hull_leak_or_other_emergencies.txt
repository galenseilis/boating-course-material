HULL LEAK OR OTHER EMERGENCIES
There are a few steps and procedures to take when your boat takes on water.

First, locate the source of the water leak by bailing out water or pumping with a bilge water pump. Is there a leak in the hull? Is an underwater component defective such as the engineâ€™s water cooling system or electric pumps? Did you forget to install the rear drain plug? Once you have discovered where the water is entering the vessel, stop the leakage. If it is an underwater hull breach, use any type of plug (such as a piece of wood) in order to try to close the hole. If it is a crack caused by friction on a rock use an epoxy that hardens or catalyses underwater. If the hole is below the water line, you must generally remove the pleasure craft from the water in order to correct the problem. These are things to do with the assumption that you carry some or all the repair material on board, or that you can easily have access to damaged areas. Every emergency situation must be assessed properly in order to prevent further emergencies or even loss of life.

Once the leak has been sealed, remove the water that has accumulated in the hold or other compartments by using the handheld bailers, manual pumps or the bilge pumping system depending on the size of the boat. This might be a situation where you might have to use distress signals to indicate you need assistance. If necessary use channel 16 on your marine radio with a MAY DAY signal or use the pyrotechnic distress signals. The pleasure craft operator should always have the tools and the necessary material onboard to stop a hull leak or a flood. The operator should always assess the situation and establish the safety risks for all people on board.

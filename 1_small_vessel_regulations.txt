SMALL VESSEL REGULATIONS
This regulation explains the minimum safety equipment required on board the craft according to the length and type of vessel. Moreover, the regulations forbid the navigation of a craft that is not seaworthy under any circumstances. Also, the operator should maintain his pleasure craft and its equipment on a regular basis, to ensure that everything works adequately at all times in order to reduce the risk of possible breakdowns.

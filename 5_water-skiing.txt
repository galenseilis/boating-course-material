WATER-SKIING
Water-skiing and other water sports include all sports in which a person is being towed by a craft. The Small Vessel Regulations (section 1005) gives very precise rules that must be followed in order to endure everybody’s safety, both on board and on the water. Other than the operator, there must be another person on board to keep a lookout at every person being towed and is communicating with the operator of the boat. There must also be enough seating capacity in the boat to accommodate every person being towed. For instance, if you are towing someone with a personal water craft, it must have seating capacity of at least three people to tow one person. The initial two-seater PWC’s are thus no longer acceptable for water sport towing. Every person being towed must be wearing a personal flotation device or lifejacket or it must be available in the boat for all those who being towed. This is the same rule that requires that every person on board must have a personal flotation device or lifejacket of appropriate size to be available for them.

It is prohibited to tow anybody in periods of restricted visibility or in the period beginning one hour after sunset and ending at sunrise. Water sports have a certain degree of risk and danger; it would be responsible and logical not to increase these risks and danger by not following these safety regulations on water sports.

The Small Vessel Regulations, section 1005 that was just explained is not applicable in situations where a vessel is operated during formal training, during competition or in a skill demonstration. However the vessel must nonetheless meet the safety requirements of a governing body respecting that training, competition or demonstration.

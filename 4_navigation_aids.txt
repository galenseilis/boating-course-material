NAVIGATION AIDS
Navigation aids are systems or devices external to the boat that warn of any hazards or obstacles such as shallow areas. They also help determine one’s position on the water and to find the best route to one’s destination. These guidance devices could be buoys, lighthouses, marine maps and other aids to navigation.

On the craft, marine charts (or hydro-graphic charts) are graphic nautical representations that indicate the different bodies of water such as shipping lanes. The charts give the depth of the water, underwater dangers and hazards, shallow areas, rocks, wrecks, etc. There are also other guides to navigation to be noted such as buoys, day beacons and lighthouses. These may point to adjacent waters for navigation (neighbouring coastal areas), points of reference such as bridges and their height, towers, buoys, etc. These are used to simplify navigation. It is important to mention that you have access to updates for your charts in the Notices to Mariners published by the Canadian Coast Guard.

Marine charts have particular characteristics that do not exist on ordinary maps. They have the 32 points of the compass which allow one to trace one’s exact route and even help determine one’s exact position. Large scale charts, which show a section of the territory, are often very useful as they are more detailed.

The chart #1 includes all the signs and abbreviations used on Canadian marine charts. It is actually the reference chart that covers all Canadian territories that are scaled down in a more detailed map.

The topographic maps are used for traveling on land and show natural characteristics of the land above the water and details of the land areas, which include artificial land obstacles, elevation points, coasts and rocks.

They do not include underwater dangers, navigation aids, channels and anchorage areas.

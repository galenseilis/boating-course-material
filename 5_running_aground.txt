RUNNING AGROUND
Running aground is often due to the fact that the operator is not familiar with the area they are navigating. The Collisions Regulations stipulate that you must carry charts on board so as to be familiar with the area. You must know your water depth, not only for safety, but to avoid damages to the engineâ€™s propeller. Propeller strikes on the bottom of the water area can also cause important ecological and sometimes environmental damages.

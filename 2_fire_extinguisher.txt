FIRE EXTINGUISHER
A pleasure craft must carry a fire extinguisher. Depending on the size of the boat and the type of appliances on board, more than one fire extinguisher could be needed (see details in chart on pages 25 to 28). You must familiarize yourself with your fire extinguisher by reading the manufacturer’s instructions. As for all safety equipment on board, they should be in good working conditions with sufficient pressure. To prevent the chemical agent from clumping together, you should shake forcefully in the upside down position the fire extinguisher at least once a month. Portable fire extinguishers are classed according to the type of fire that they can put on. Here are the categories of fire extinguishers:

A: Effective against solid combustibles (wood, textile, paper, etc…)
B: Effective against liquid combustibles (gas, grease, oil, paint and inflammables.)
C: Effective against electrical fires; (engine, the dashboard and electric cables.)

The number before each letter corresponds to their effectiveness for extinguishing a fire. For example: A 5BC fire extinguisher can put on a fire with less intensity than a 10BC fire extinguisher.
